#Tree Cage - A visual representation of PHP-Binary-Tree

This project is a visual representation - in HTML and JavaScript - of the php-binary-tree project.
It is a simple representation of a binary tree written in PHP that you can view with your browser.

## Deployment
* Copy the project to the desired location
* Change directory to this location, which should be at the root of the project directory
* Run the util/deploy executable
 * You will be asked to add the root url to the utility.  If you are deploying it on its own site, you can leave this empty.
* Create a symlink to the live document root that links to the project `public` directory, if needed

##Use

Visit the utility in your browser.  You can click ```Default``` to see the default tree sample display.

##TODO

Currently, 'add' and the visual versions of the traversal methods do not work.  These need to be updated.
